# Art Gallery Website Development Plan

## Information Gathered
- Existing React app in `testapp/` with basic structure: App.js, App.css, index.js, etc.
- App.js currently displays a logo, text, and link.
- App.css has basic styling for the header and logo animation.
- The app is set up with Create React App.

## Plan
- [x] Update `App.js` to render an art gallery layout with a header, gallery grid, and footer.
- [x] Create a new component `Gallery.js` to display artworks in a grid.
- [x] Create a new component `Artwork.js` for individual artwork items with placeholder images and details.
- [x] Update `App.css` to style the gallery layout, grid, and components.
- [x] Add placeholder artwork data (e.g., array of objects with title, artist, image URL).

## Dependent Files to be Edited
- [x] `testapp/src/App.js`: Main component to integrate gallery.
- [x] `testapp/src/App.css`: Styling updates.
- [x] New files: `testapp/src/Gallery.js`, `testapp/src/Artwork.js`.

## Followup Steps
- [x] Run the app locally to verify functionality.
- [ ] Test responsiveness and add media queries if needed.
- [ ] Optionally, add more features like search or modal for artwork details.
